        <h2>What we provide</h2>
        <p>
          Bookkeeping can be a time consuming and technically complex task, however, there is often not enough work involved to justify a permanent in-house employee. Outsourcing this task can be a very cost-effective way to ensure the task is completed accurately and efficiently while also introducing best practice procedures to keep year-end statutory accountancy fees down. We help small to medium sized businesses that would like to concentrate on running and growing their business.

<h2>Payroll Services</h2>
<p>Payroll administration can be time consuming. As a business owner and an employer in the UK, you may have to operate PAYE (Pay As You Earn) as a part of your payroll. PAYE is a system that HM Revenue and Customs’ (HMRC) use to collect Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions from the employees’ earnings. You need to report and pay HMRC every month. Managing all these is not easy, especially for small businesses.
<br>
The service we provide is flexible, processing your payroll from start to finish leaving you free to focus on running your business.

        <h2>Making Tax Digital ( MTD )</h2>
        <p>
          Making Tax Digital (MTD) came into effect in April 2019 affecting all VAT Registered businesses. It is a fundamental change to the UK tax system, affecting how UK businesses maintain their accounting records.
          <br><br>
          All businesses with turnover above the VAT registration threshold will be required to maintain their accounting records DIGITALLY using a recognised accounting software. ( Recognised by the HMRC )
          <br><br>
          Businesses which do not maintain digital accounting records or submit their VAT Return to HMRC digitally will face financial penalties.
          <br><br>
          Software such as Xero, Quickbooks and Sage Business Cloud Accounts are MTD ready and use of these software will ensure that a business is MTD compliant.

“Having operated for a numbers of years and fought the daily battle of invoices, receipts, VAT returns, and all the other mundane ‘must-do’ bits that the businesses requires, it was a breath of fresh air and a massive weight lifted to have RockBookkeeping manage these elements for us. They are professional, prompt, polite, and take a real interest in your business. Whether it be providing monthly management accounts or transferring our whole accounting system to a different platform, no job is too big or small and it is approached in the same focused and committed manner – they are simply brilliant and quite honestly I couldn’t operate effectively without them. I cannot recommend them highly enough.”<br><br>

“We’ve worked with Di for several years and she and her firm have been excellent. Rock Bookkeeping have been reliably and consistent, whilst remaining financial competitive in a busy accountancy market. Rock Bookkeeping costings are clear and transparent. <br>Di is very professional & offers advice when we need it and has helped us in other areas such as Personnel and Recruitment. Working directly with the business owner has huge benefits than working with a larger, perhaps more impersonal accountancy firm. We have worked with many bookkeeping companies over our 17 years in a business and only wish we found RockBookkeeping earlier. We would recommend their services to anyone looking for a reliable, friendly and professional outfit”.

"Greg took over as Treasurer of the <strong>Liverpool Male Voice Choir</strong> at our AGM in June 2019. Despite the issues with lockdown - we were very impressed with the quality of his accounts and even more impressed with his financial report presented to the choir at our online AGM in June 2020. The presentation of the accounts using his bespoke software was easily to understand and enabled us to project into the current year - ( assuming that we could have operated normally without the Covid restrictions ).
<br>Although he obviously does our accounts on a voluntary basis - I would have no hesitation in recommending his services on a professional basis"<br><br>
